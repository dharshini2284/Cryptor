# Cryptor 🔐

## 📝 Project Overview
Cryptor is a file encryption and decryption tool developed in Python, ensuring secure data protection using **Fernet encryption** and **PBKDF2HMAC** for strong key derivation. The system is designed for efficient processing of large files with **multi-threading**, offers **RAID 1-inspired backup** for data reliability. A Tkinter-based GUI provides an intuitive way to select files, encrypt, and decrypt them seamlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Encryption & Decryption:** Uses **Fernet encryption** for strong security.
- **Key Derivation:** Implements **PBKDF2HMAC** for robust password-based key generation.
- **Multi-Threading:** Enhances performance for large file processing.
- **RAID 1-Inspired Backup:** Ensures data redundancy and reliability.
- **Intuitive GUI:** Built with **Tkinter** for easy user interaction.
- **Concurrent Processing & Synchronization:** Improves efficiency and user experience.
